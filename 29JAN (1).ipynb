    "Who developed the python programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Van Rossum is a Dutch programmer and software developer who started the project to create Python as a hobby project, with the goal of creating an easy-to-use and powerful scripting language. Python was first released in 1991 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, with a large and active community of developers and users.\n",

    "Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has full support for object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes, objects, and inherit properties and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts such as first-class functions, closures, and higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming: Python also supports procedural programming, where the focus is on writing procedures or functions that operate on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative Programming: Python has support for imperative programming, where the emphasis is on how the program operates and changes a system's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers, such as variables, functions, and class names.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the correct extension of the python file?\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct extension for a Python file is .py.\n",
    "Note: There are also other file extensions used for Python, such as .pyc and .pyo, which are compiled bytecode files, but they are usually not created or used directly by developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. This means that the code is executed line by line, rather than being compiled into machine-executable code prior to execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code that are used to define in python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are several blocks of code used to define code blocks and control structures, including:\n",
    "Functions: defined using the \"def\" keyword and contain a block of code that can be called and executed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes: defined using the \"class\" keyword and represent objects and their methods in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements: used to execute a block of code based on whether a condition is True or False, such as \"if\" and \"if-else\" statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops: used to repeat a block of code multiple times, such as \"for\" and \"while\" loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try-except blocks: used to handle exceptions and errors that may occur in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These blocks of code are used to structure the logic and flow of your code, allowing you to write clear and readable code that can be easily understood and maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.State a character used to give a single line comment in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the character \"#\" is used to give a single line comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find which version of python we are working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the following functions to find the version of Python you are working on:\n",
    "\n",
    "sys.version: returns a string containing information about the Python version, including the version number, build number, and compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "sys.version_info: returns a named tuple containing information about the Python version, including the major, minor, and micro version numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "platform.python_version(): returns a string containing the version number of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called\n",
    "\"lambda\" functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "\n",
    "PIP stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\"\n",
    "\n",
    "11.  Mention a few built-in functions in python?\n",
    "\n",

    "len(): used to get the length of a list, string, or other iterable object\n",
    "int(): used to convert a value to an integer\n",
    "float(): used to convert a value to a floating-point number\n",
    "str(): used to convert a value to a string\n",
    "max(): used to find the maximum value in a list or other iterable object\n",
    "min(): used to find the minimum value in a list or other iterable object\n",
    "sum(): used to calculate the sum of a list or other iterable object\n",
    "sorted(): used to sort a list or other iterable object\n",
    "abs(): used to get the absolute value of a number\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
